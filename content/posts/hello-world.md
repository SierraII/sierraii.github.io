This site serves as **a personal journey of learning and exploration**, with the hope that any insights shared along the way may also benefit others.

Most pages will act as living documents and get updated with new learnings and findings. 

While the topics will span multiple different domains and contexts, the following Operating Principles will be held to the highest standard:
- **Egoless**: A mindset of collaboration and humility in every aspect of work and learning;
- **Exploration without Intent**: Encouraging curiosity and discovery, without the pressure of immediate results;
- **First make it work, then make it beautiful**: Prioritize functionality before optimization or aesthetics;
