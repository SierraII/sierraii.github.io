The purpose of this site is to **document** and **share** some of my **learnings** over the past decade of Engineering - both as a professional and a hobbiest Software Engineer.

The **title** of the site is not a necessarily a reflection of who I am or who you should become. It simply **serves as a reminder and operating principle for me to adhere to, regardless of the context.**

I hope the content will teach and inspire you to become a better, well rounded Engineer.
